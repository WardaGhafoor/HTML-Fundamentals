Summary
    In this module we've looked at how HTML or the hypertext markup language allows us to create documents tha
    we can share over the Web using the http protocol. We've seen that they have unique URIs or URLs that we 
    can use to address a particular document and we'll talk more about those when we get into linking. And I've 
    provided a few links here for you for tools that we've used in terms of the validator so you can take an 
    HTML document either as a file or paste in the text or point to URL and validate that it matches with the 
    DTD you've provided. And also a list of the valid DTDs that you can choose from and easy way for you to 
    copy and paste those if your HTML editing tool doesn't provide that. We looked at the doctype, the head 
    and the body, those core elements of an HTML document. And as we move through the course we'll see all the 
    various things now that we can add to the body to create our content, to provide visual cues to people about
    headings and lists, tables, charts, graphs and link these things together.
