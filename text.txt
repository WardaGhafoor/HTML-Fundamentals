Block vs Inline
     I'll put the divs on the same line and refresh, and I have the same output. These are block level elements.


     Div will take its own block b/c it is by default block level container.
    
    
    We can nested div insie a div but a div will not be nested inside a p tag.
  

    span tag can be used in p tag.
