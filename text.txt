1 - Introduction
       World Wide Web is created by Tim Berners-Lee and the Web, the World Wide Web is actually made up of
       a few different things.Our focus here is HTML.


       And HTML is the language that we use to create documents that we want to share across the World Wide
       Web or more appropriately across the internet. We want to share these documents using network topology.


       Another piece of that is the notion of a universal resource identifying or universal resource locator,
       the URI or URL. We have an address for a particular HTML document.That's a big piece of the Web is 
       being able to go out and use an address to get a particular document that we're interested in.


       And finally if we watch our HTML document we have the HTTP protocol, hypertext transfer protocol which
       is all about taking those documents and exchanging them at layers on top of the internet protocols and 
       provides us a language for exchanging these documents.
