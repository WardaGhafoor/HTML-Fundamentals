There are many different standards out there we can follow or that we can use in terms of 
document type declarations. Even for HTML 4 we have a strict, a transitional and a frame
set. Likewise for XHTML. The strict means we're going to follow only those items that are actually in
the standard and have not been deprecated. So there are several items that have been deprecated in 
there that you'll want to avoid if you're following the strict whereas the transitional or loose means
that you're following it but you also might be using some of those items that have been deprecated.
