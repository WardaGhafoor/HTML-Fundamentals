Introduction:
    This module is about text elements. When you think about HTML documents, primarily they were focused on 
    text when originally intended. Now, today when you go to a website you end up seeing a lot of images 
    and flash videos and all sorts of things that aren't textural. But the focus of HTML was originally 
    documents, and document text. So we'll be talking about things such as headings, but also things like 
    block and inline elements, or this notion of "As I'm adding things to the document, how are they going 
    to be handled and rendered within the document?" Some of those things will contain text, but they may 
    also be generic containers for other items. We'll talk about text breaking and white space a little bit, 
    how you can control where things break or where they don't and formatting. And then we'll talk about a 
    variety of elements you can use to call out specific text or maybe you're using abbreviations, quotations, 
    you're referencing other things, or you're including things like code snippets or keyboard input that you 
    want somebody to type.
