1 - Introduction
      World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners-Lee and the Web, the World Wide Web is actually made up of a few
      different things. Our focus here is HTML.
      
      And HTML is a language that we use to create documents that we want to share across the World Wide Web or
      more appropriately across the Internet. We want to share these documents using URI/URL network topology. 
      
      Another piece of that is the notion of universal resource identifying or universal resource locater, the
      URI or URL. We have an address of a particular HTML document.That's a big piece of the Web is being able
      to go out and use an address to get a particular document that we're interested in.
      
      And finally if we watch our HTML document we have HTTP protocol, hypertext transfer protocol which is all
      about taking those documents and exchange them at layers on top of protocols and provide us a language for 
      exchanging these documents. So the HTML hypertext markup language, http hypertext transfer protocol.
